4. Innovative Idea

Our application can be viewed as a sort of pseudo extension to discord. On discord you can see all your friends, what games they are playing and have different servers to talk amongst your friends. Our website will be similar to this except we are going to different channels for different games. For example, we can have channels for chess, backgammon, slither.io, and other free online games. In each channel there will be a place to chat amongst others in the channel, and a place to set up games with other players. Once all the players join a certain game instance, they will be placed in a new channel that lets them text chat and also provides a link directly to the game so that all players can join. If a bunch of players want to see how fast they can beat a certain flash game then they will all get linked to that game and can play individually, while also being able to talk with each other. Zoom links can be sent as well so if people want to play a game like mafia, Dungeons and Dragons or something of the sort they can use other video call services for that. The point of our application is connecting users who want to find other people who enjoy the same games.

5. Important Components

    b) a component that allows users to friend each other and communicate and interact with friends
    c) component that stores different channels for different games
    d) in each channel a component for setting up a game, and a chat component
